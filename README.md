Providing Care to Our Dogs
=======================================

It is important to note that different types of dogs exist that are of different breeds and wide variance. The owners are the ones now who are supposed to make sure that they create appropriate conditions to make sure that their dogs exist. One has to know what it takes to care for their dog in the right manner. So one has to care for their dog in the best appropriate manner as follows:

One has to make sure that that their home is maintained safe for the existence of the dog. One has to note that some plants found in the compounds may be toxic to these animals and so may cause death to the dog. Such should be avoided when one wants to keep the dogs in their compound. Any form of medicine should be placed away from reach of one’s dog. It should have to be treated as a child.

Another thing is that you should correct any form of bad behavior of your dog the first time you notice it. Otherwise if you let the behavior fester in the animal, the dog may eventually become very hard to train. And like any form of training, discipline comes as a first priority. So you have to make sure that the dog is much disciplined. Correcting the behavior once you observe it is the first step in ensuring that your dog is disciplined.

One should also make sure that the dogs vet comes to visit the animal and conduct various observations to make sure that the dog is always safe. This will have reduced the rink of the animal getting to be affected by some life threatening diseases which could lead to death of the animal. On the other hand, this will have reduced ones money on the vet bill since the serious diseases have been already avoided. Still since the risk of the dog’s death has been reduced, one will feel at peace always since the lifespan of the animal is still high.

One should also be aware of the rights of the animal in regard to the constitution. One should be well alert on these political issues which favor the animal since it has a right for its existence.

One is at times tempted to share what they are eating, with their dog. However, it is much important to note that our foods may not be fit for the consumption of our animals. These animals may get illnesses as a result of these foods if we share with them. Such foods which are not fit for the consumption of these animals include grapes, caffeine among others. People should give a second thought before trying these new ideas to their animals as some are harmful to these creatures.

For the fitness of the dog, make sure by the end of each day, the animal has some time for it to stretch and move around the compound. Let it play and do these exercises which eventually make the animal become so delighted. This is both physically and mentally. This will also tighten the bond between you and your dog. This is especially the case if you do the playing together with your dog.

Do not allow the dog to move out on its own without your watch. A dog is an animal and it is prone to attract the attention of other wild animals which could bring harm to your dog. Still some neighbors could get jealous to the animal and decide to harm it. It may end up with some dangerous illnesses and eventually you may find your animal dead. You should note that the safety and behavior of your dog is entirely your responsibility.

When training your dog, make sure you are doing it in a safe place and in a quiet place which is not having people coming to distract the dog. It may tend to be a very hard task trying to train your dog in a place which is full of people. It will tend to lose the attention due to the distractions coming from people.

One should keep into considerations all the above points to ensure a smooth flow between you and your animal. Remember your dog is not human and so it has the thinking of an animal and not a human being.
